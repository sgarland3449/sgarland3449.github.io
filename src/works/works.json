        "summary": "From forest to clear cut, the Alcazar to the York to the Raja Theatre, the corner of what is now Commercial Drive and East Georgia has lived many lives. There was a time in which the site sat vacant, and in this moment many “what if” possibilities arise. At this moment, we’re treating the building as a person that has passed on to the afterlife. The theatre sits on the site among a mature forest, where the site’s past and present exist simultaneously, with only the original proscenium arch, a screen, projector, and a single seat existing in the afterlife. \nOur afterlife takes on the idea of the imaginative and regretful question, “what if”, and gives people who come here the chance to ask a “what if” question and watch it be played out on the theatre's screen. The purpose of exploring a what if is not for indulging fantasies, but to resolve unknowns, to take lessons from this life into the next. New arrivals to the afterlife are presented with different “what if” scenarios through their own memory items which are cast in tree resin along the trunk of a tree. Objects can be a reflection of someone’s life, holding memories and reminding them of choices made and the potential “what ifs” they might have pondered before.",

The Inn also serves as the dispatch centre for First Light’s transportation program. This project involved minor interventions to the ground floor of the building to create both a more functional inn space, and a stronger sense of home and comfort for visitors to the inn. The reception area was upgraded with a custom L-shaped desk, and custom storage cabinetry. In the living area, a coffee station and credenza were designed to create a more comfortable area for lounging. New furniture was selected for the space to make it bright and welcoming. The clients also wanted a space to exbihit art work by local indigenous artists, so spotlights were added to highlight the works. I worked closely with an Intern Architect in the office on millwork design, lighting and furniture selection,  rendering and compiling design documents for client presentation. Art displayed in the renderings is not my own but the work of the following talented indigenous artists from Newfoundland - Jordan Bennett, Nelson White, and Meagan Musseau. It was important to include the work of indigenous artists in visualisations of the room to give a areal sense of how the rooms will look once First Light can exhibit art there.",

The pavilion blooms open to offer place to sit and relax. Parametric design allowed for an iterative and experimental design process that holds a direct engagement with the fabrication process. A script written in Grasshopper defined the geometry, which was fed directly to a Kuka Robot, which cut all the individual pieces for assembly. Blossom uses repetitive components set to varying degrees to form an organic arch structure. The initial design concept involved explorations into the connection between a petal and wedge. The wedge is used to prop the petal up to provide support and facilitate in generating an overall form. The result is a structure that is made up of two components, a petal and wedge, that are doweled together. Each wedge has a set of 2 teeth on either side that connect into the corresponding petal at a series of angles, made possible only by an 8-axis industrial robot. The teeth of the stacked wedges are then doweled together to maintain a rigid structure as the components blossom and fold to form an organic arch pavilion.",

We suggested the addition of out buildings at the top of the hill to create a place to enjoy the ocean views on nice weather days. Additionally, remaining on the site were two concrete root cellars belonging to the original family home .These root cellars were to remain, and the house is sited in a way which makes them a feature in the outdoor space carved out at of the home. My role in this project included initial site massing concepts and the completion of renderings for client presentations. ",

The exploration began by testing the properties of active bent and kerf cut bent plywood in a number of thicknesses and species of plywood. Simultaneously, experiments in form and composition were carried out using study models of a range of scales. Once we decided to experiment with creating an undulating textile like surface using these kerfcut sheets, physical tests and digitizing were integrated with digital modelling and simulation. This created a feedback loop which guided iteration of design elements and experimentation with the composition of the pavilion. Each group member had a hand in design iteration and simulations, additionally I focused on development of the panelizing system, model building and physical testing.",

The meeting of mixed industrial materials such as gravel, brick and rebar with vegetation and natural materials transform the landscape into an experience of familiar urban forms and spontaneous vegetation and habitation.
